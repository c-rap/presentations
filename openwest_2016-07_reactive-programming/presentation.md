## What is Reactive?

* Declarative.
* React to an event.
* A unified API for sync & async operations.

<div class="notes">
* DOM Events
* Ajax Events
* Server-sent Events
* Websockets
* setInterval, setTimeout
* Service Workers
* jQuery events, Node streams, etc.
</div>

# Learning Rx

## Common API

> It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10
> functions on 10 data structures.

## Rx API

* Large API, but...

* Filtering: `filter`
* Transforming: `map`, `reduce`
* Collecting: `scan`
* Buffering: `take`, `takeLast`, `pauseable`/`pauseableBuffered`
* Combining: `merge`/`concat`, `flatMap`/`concatMap`, `combineLatest`

## Primitives

* Observer.
* Observable.
* Subscriptions.
* Disposables.

## Language Implementations

C#, C# (Unity), C++, Clojure, Groovy, JRuby, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python,
Ruby, Scala, and Swift.

Platform-specific support for Android, Cocoa, and Netty.

# Short Examples

## Ajax Request

```js
var mySubscription = Rx.DOM.get('https://api.github.com/users')
    .subscribe(response => console.log('Got response', response));
```

## DOM Events

```js
var domEl = document.querySelector('#thelink');
var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(el, 'click')
    .scan(acc => acc + 1, 0)
    .subscribe(count => console.log(`Seen ${count} clicks.`));
```

## Server-sent events

```js
var source = Rx.DOM.fromEventSource("/events");
source.map(JSON.parse).subscribe(
    msg => console.log('msg', msg),
    err => console.log('Stream complete.'));
```

## Polling

```js
var results = Rx.Observable.interval(20000)
    .flatMapLatest(() => Rx.DOM.get('https://api.github.com/users'))
    .distinctUntilChanged()
    .subscribe(x => console.log('New results: ', x));
```

## Combine Ajax Requests

```js
var combinedResults = Rx.DOM.getJSON('https://api.github.com/users/1')
    .flatMap(user_resp => Rx.DOM.getJSON(user_resp.followers_url)
        .map(followers => ({user: user_resp, followers}));
    });
```

# Implementation

## Observer

* A consumer.
* Optional next, error, and completed methods.

```js
var myObserver = {
    onNext: x => console.log('Got value', x),
    onError: err => console.log('Got error', err),
    onCompleted: () => console.log('Completed'),
};
```

</div>

## Observable

* A function that takes an observer and returns a cancellation function.
* Glue to connect a producer to a consumer (observer).

```js
function myObservable(observer) {
    setTimeout(() => observer.onNext('Hello'), 1000);
    setTimeout(() => observer.onCompleted(), 2000);

    return function() {
        console.log('Canceled.');
    };
}
```

## Common Observable Sources

`just`, `from`, `range`, `fromEvent`, `fromEventPattern`, `fromCallback`,
`fromNodeCallback`, `fromPromise`, `generate`, `generateWithAbsoluteTime`,
`generateWithRelativeTime`

## Subscriptions and Disposables

Start Listening:
```js
var mySubscription = myObservable.subscribe(myObserver);
```

Stop Listening:
```js
mySubscription.dispose();
```

Stop Listening Automatically:
```js
mySubscription.take(3);
```

## Cold vs. Hot

* Movie vs. live performance.

## Operators

```js
function map(source, projectionFn) {
    return new Observable(function(observer) {
        var mapObserver = {
            onNext: x => observer.next(projectionFn(x)),
            onError: err => observer.onError(err),
            onCompleted: observer.onCompleted(),
        };

        return source.subscribe(mapObserver);
    });
}
```

<div class="notes">
Subscriptions do not need to be disposed if the source completes. You may
dispose the subscription if you wish to stop listening _before_ the source is
exhausted. It's more common to dispose of subscriptions by using an operator
that terminates the subscription as part of its design like Take, TakeWhile,
TakeUntil.
</div>

## Unicast vs. Multicast

* Reuse & share the underlying subscription, or
* Subscribe individually.

1.   Create a loose outline of ideas, references, and talking points.
2.   Categorize into: must know, need to know, don't need to know (cut).
3.   Restructure into the following sections:

* Opening. Capture attention; avoid introductions and fluff.
* Current situation. Establish importance.
* Recommendation.
* Benefits. Personalize for the audience.
* Evidence. Support the recommendation; don't revisit current situation.
* Summary. Short!
* Action steps. Specific actions; specific time-frame.

Reactive programming has gotten a lot of attention this year and for good
reason. It presents a unified API for asynchronous operations and
drastically reduces having to manage application state. The result is often
terse code that presents a simple interface on complex operations.

Reactive programming itself is composed of a few simple primitives. Popular
reactive libraries have built high-level and often large interfaces on
those low-level parts which can make learning reactive programming feel
daunting and academic for newcomers. A good grasp of the fundamentals
paired with real-world examples can make the large API approachable and
even appreciated.

This talk will provide an introduction to reactive programming by building
an observer and an observable, and then exploring a wide range of
real-world problems. We will demo event listeners, user interaction, HTTP
requests, retrying failed operations, live data streaming, tracking
application state, as well as methods of combining all those into a single
data stream. All examples are plucked from production code and adapted for
a presentation format.

Code examples will use the popular, mature, and performant ReactiveX
library from Microsoft -- specifically the JavaScript port RxJS -- but the
examples are directly applicable to other language ports. At the time of
this writing ReactiveX has been ported to the following languages and
platforms: C#, C#(Unity), C++, Clojure, Groovy, JRuby, Java, JavaScript,
Kotlin, Python, Ruby, Scala, and Swift. Plus platform-specific support for
Android, Cocoa, and Netty.  :-D
